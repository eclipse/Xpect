   XPECT_SETUP org.xpect.tests.runner.RunnerTest END_SETUP

test passes: green 
XPECT expectedExpectation --> expectedExpectation

tests fails: can assert the error as a diff
XPECT testFailureDiff --> ['other'|expectedExpectation]
XPECT expectedExpectation --> 'other'

test fails as expected by FIXME, therefore the test is green
XPECT FIXME expectedExpectation --> "a xyz"

the test passes as *not* expected by FIXME, therefore we can assert an error message
XPECT testFailureMessage --> Congrats, this FIXME test is suddenly fixed!
XPECT FIXME expectedExpectation --> expectedExpectation
